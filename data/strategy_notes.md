### 1M Entry Trigger
- Mentioned 4x across all videos — Confidence: MEDIUM
- Example quotes:
  > "...k open zone marked out, you're going to go to the 1 minute time frame and you're going to wait for a break above or below this zone. and the key thing here is that you want this break to happen at around 9:30 a.m. eastern standard time or anytime after that. if it happens before that, it's likely that we don't have enough volume for this zone to actually give us the move that we're looking for. all right, guys. so, you can see that it's currently around 9:30 a.m. in this example, and we just had a clear break to the top of this zone, meaning i'm going to look for longs. and when i like to take my entry, guys, i take my entry right around this midpoint. so, what i do is i place my entry at this midpoint, and i place my stop loss around five points below this midpoint. and i like to target around 15 points, right? so, let's see how this trade plays out. i'm going to go ahead and hit play. see if it was a winner or a loser. boom. order filled. let's see what happens. let's see what happens. still in the trade. still in the trade. all good. little choppy, but we're still in. boom, guys. 15 points. take profit. that's what we do. i'm going to show you guys exactly why i place my stop loss where i did in this example, so you can understand exactly how to trade this strategy. the reason i place my stop loss slightly below this asia low is because asia low will often act as a magnet for price. so, when i am looking at price, i want to look at clear zones of invalidation. meaning, how do i know i am wrong? and if price were to come to this asia low, it would have been pretty clear to me that i was wrong and that it was time to get out of the trade. this was an actual trade that i took on my live futures account, i ended up making around $5,000 off of this trade. now, you might be wondering, why does the retest work so consistently? let me explain the psychology behind it. when price first breaks out of the 8 a.m. zone, it's like the institutions are making their first move, but they're not done yet. they need to accumulate more positions at better prices. so, what do they do? they let price come back to retest the level they just broke. this serves two purposes. it shakes out weak hands who think that the breakout failed, and it allows them to add to their positions at better prices. the retest also creates what i like to call trapped liquidity. these are people who sold the breakout who thought that it was a fake or people who were waiting for a better entry. when price starts moving away from the retest level, these traders are forced to cover their positions, adding fuel to the move. this is why the retest entry has such a high success rate. you're not just trading a technical level. you're trading institutional psychology. now, you're probably thinking, "this sounds too good to be true." so, i'm going to show you some more examples from this week on exactly how profitable this strategy is. i showed you monday's example. this was a live trade that i took, catching 15 points, making me $5,600 on my live account. now, let's go to tuesday and see how this worked. we are now on tuesday's chart. let's go ahead and start with step one, marking out the first 15-minute candle from 8:00 to 8:15 a.m. eastern standard time. step one has been completed. now, let's go to step two, which is going to be to go on the 1 minute time frame and identify the break. looking like we are breaking out to the downside, everybody. meaning, i am going to be looking for shorts off of a retest of this zone. real quick, i'm going to pause it so you guys can see exactly how i take my entry. it's very clear to me that we are breaking out to the downside. so, that means that i'm going to look for shorts. my entry is going to be right at this midpoint and my stop loss is going to be slightly above the top of this zone. i am targeting 15 points. so, my risk-to-reward is about 1 to4. let's go ahead and see how this trade plays out, guys. see if we can get filled. nope, not filled yet. boom. order filled in that trade. let's see if it plays out. boom. 15 points. that's what we do, everybody. we actually ended up catching a little bit more than 15 points if we were to let that trade run. but we don't get greedy. we are scalpers. follow the plan. absolute win on that specific trade that i just showed you guys. i made around $6,000. now, we're on wednesday's chart. let's go ahead and test this strategy once again and see if it's still profitable. as always, we're going to start with step one, which is marking out our zone. zone is marked out. now we are going to wait and see which direction price wants to break to. we are going to go on the 1 minute time frame though so we can identify a clear entry. let's see. okay guys, it appears that price is breaking out to the upside, meaning i'm going to go ahead and look for longs. so i'm going to take my little tool like so. i'm going to put my entry at the midpoint. as always, i'm going to have my stop loss slightly below this zone, right next to this low. let's see if it plays out. all righty, guys. let's see if we can get filled on this trade. boom. filled in that trade. filled again. out of that trade for 15 points. that is what we do, everybody. i promised you i would show you results, and that's exactly what i'm doing. we did have some news that day, so i wasn't risking as much money, but i made around $4,300 on that specific trade right there. now, we are on thursday's chart. let's see if the strategy still works. marking out our 8 a.m. candle, like so. and the thing to remember here, guys, is we did have some news at around 8:45. so, i'm honestly just not going to pay too much attention to anything happening before 9:30 a.m. eastern standard time when i'm using this strategy because news is not something that we can predict. news, trading news is gambling. so, we just avoid that and we wait until 9:30, which is when the institutional money comes in and when we can actually find some clean moves. so, we are going to go down to the 1 minute time frame. and as you guys can see, it appears that we are breaking above this zone. so, we are going to do what we usually do. we are going to go ahead and put our stop loss slightly below this zone like so about five points. we are going to have our entry right there. and we are going to target 15 points. let's see if we can make som..."
  > "...h way too late. so that's why i like to go on the 1 minute and the 5minut to observe exactly how price is reacting and if price is having a strong reaction i like to get in catch that trade. so this strategy is super simple. it's profitable but i'll be honest with you there is one major flaw. i have to be in front of the computer to trade it. and that's where the problem started for me. i originally got into trading because i wanted freedom from my job, from a schedule, from somebody else telling me what to do. and yeah, trading gave me that. but over the past few months, i'm not going to lie to you guys, i caught myself feeling like i just traded one job for another job. i was sitting in front of my computer all day long watching the president tweet, and that just didn't sit right with me. if you guys don't know, my godfather spent over 30 years at goldman sachs, and he told me the one thing he regretted most was time. he said, "time is our most precious asset. we will never get more time, so spend it doing what you absolutely love." that really stuck with me because yes, i love trading and the freedom it can create, but what i love more is spending time with my family, spending time with my dogs, going on walks, and making sure i'm healthy. i did not enjoy being glued from my desk from 8:00 a.m. to 300 p.m. every single day just waiting for these setups. i was completely chained to my screen. i hated missing family events. i even missed a wedding that i really did not want to miss. and i hated not being able to travel. and more than anything, i hated that my entire life revolved around the market open. it just got repetitive and stressful. so, i set out to build a better way. a way that would let me be 100% emotionless so that i would never hesitate on entries or wonder what if this is the one that fails. i needed to never cut my winners too early because i was scared to give some profits back. and i needed to never revenge trade after a loss trying to make it back. even though i was profitable, i knew i was still deep down my own worst enemy. i remember one night i stayed up until 1:30 a.m. to trade one of the overnight sessions because there was something going on with the chinese trade deal. i was exhausted. i was sleepd deprived. i made some money, right? but my eyes were burning and i was just staring at the screen. eventually, i literally fell asleep on my desk chair. and then a few hours later, i woke up. i looked at the chart and i was like, "this is not the way that i'm going to do this thing." i realized that yes, i made money, but i was losing valuable time and valuable sleep. that was the moment that i realized i cannot do this forever. i already knew that the strategy worked. the data proved it. but i also knew that i was the weakest link in the system. i needed a way to completely remove myself from the equation. i needed a way to automate it. so that's exactly what i did. i hired a team of developers and we spent the last 2 and 1/2 years building an algorithm that trades this exact liquidity strategy 100% automatically. we call it the rp liquidity bot. right here you can see that this trade was executed fully automatically. um this is the entry. we entered right there at the low and this is the exit. the bot goes ahead and..."

### Volume Confirmation
- Mentioned 2x across all videos — Confidence: LOW
- Example quotes:
  > "...time. this is when the stock market opens and the volume comes in. once you wait for 9:30, you see which direction price is breaking out to. in this example, we broke out to the upside, so we were looking for longs once we got the retest. step three, do not enter on the break. wait for price to come back and retest the broken level. once this midpoint holds, showing you that there's demand, or doesn't hold, showing you that there's weakness, that's your entry. why does this work? because institutions need to accumulate positions. the retest is where they add to their positions at better prices. when price is bouncing off the midpoint, that is your signal. your stop goes just beyond the zone on the opposite side. right here, my stop is around 4 and a half points. your target is typically 15 to 20 points on a 1 to three risk-to-reward minimum. as far as time frames, i like to go down to the 1 minute time frame to see exactly how price is reacting to the midpoint. once i'm on the 1 minute time frame, i switch to the 5minute to see if we can get a full 5minute candle closure over the midpoint. and once we do, i like to enter expecting a continuation. you can see right here that price came down, tapped this midpoint and then immediately started showing some signs of strength right here with this big wick right here. every one minute candle closure that we get over this midpoint is just price showing more and more strength that we are going to reverse. this shows a lot of strength, right? we had a nice buying wick. retested our entry again and at that point i was pretty confident the trade was going to play out which it did. played out and i got a riskreward of about 1 to4 on this trade making me around $4,500 on that specific trade. that's setup number one. simple, clean, works almost every day. but now, let me show you the second setup that most traders never learn. setup two, liquidity sweeps. this setup is completely separate from the 8 a.m. zone. and on days where the am zone does not play out, this setup is super powerful. what's a liquidity sweep? throughout the trading session, price creates highs and lows. each one of these highs and lows has clusters of stop- losses sitting just beyond it. these are what i call untested levels, peaks and valleys that price not came back to yet. institutions know exactly where these stop losses are. so what do they do? they push price just beyond these levels to grab all that liquidity and then reverse hard in the opposite direction. this is called a liquidity sweep and it's the most predictable move in trading in my opinion. step one, identify untested highs and lows. you can do this super simply by using a free indicator called fxn asian session range by rob minty. this indicator will show you asia session in red, london session in yellow, and new york session in blue. once you have these sessions marked out, it's very easy to find untested highs and lows. for example, on monday, we had this untested london low. step two, wait for the sweep. price will push above an untested high or below an untested low. you'll see this as a long wick. price spikes to grab liquidity, then closes back on the other side of this level. you can see this literally playing out right here. step three, enter when price breaks back through the swept level. if price swept above a high and closed back below it, you go short. if price swept below a low and closed back above it, you go long. your stop goes just under the untested low. and i like to target 20 to 30 points when i'm trading this setup. in full transparency, on this trade, i only caught 15 points because i was expecting price to have a decent size reversal when it touched this level, which didn't end up playing out, but i followed my plan. i made money, so there's nothing i can complain about. when i am trading this setup, i like to monitor the 1 minute time frame to see exactly how price is reacting to this untested level. for example, if price is just breaking straight below it and it doesn't come back up to retest it, it's very likely that this is not a liquidity sweep. it's just price continuing to move in one direction. but on a day like monday, when we break through it, come back down, then break above it again, that is showing us a very clear sign that price wants to reverse. what i like to do to make sure i don't get caught in the liquidity sweep is wait for a little bit of confirmation. so, i like to wait for one 15-minute candle closure above the level showing me that that was indeed a liquidity sweep and it wasn't a fake out. when price sweeps a low, all of the people who were short get trapped. when it reverses, they're forced to exit their position, right? so, when you're exiting a short, you're actually buying back into the market, adding fuel to the move up. you're not predicting anything. you're waiting for institutions to show you where the liquidity is, grab it, and then you trade the reversal. now, i'm going to back test the strategy to prove to you that both of these setups work. here we are on monday. market opens up, and we can clearly see that we have an untested london low right there. so, we're going to go ahead and expect to get into some longs. if we can get a nice liquidity sweep of that low. let's see what happens. right, we're on the 5minut. price came down, swept this level now. we're going to switch to the 15-minute to see if we can get a candle closure. once we get that full candle closure above this level on the 15-minute, we will enter some longs. boom. in our longs right there. let's see what happens. take profit. right, we caught 15 points with a risk-to-reward of 1 to three on that specific trade. now, let's go to tuesday. tuesday gave us a beautiful break and retest setup. here's a little trick, guys. on days where we have an untested level really close to a new york open 8 am zone, i like to place my stop loss slightly below the untested low to cover myself from any potential liquidity sweeps. this means that my stop might be a little bit bigger, allowing me to target more points because not only will i capitalize from this 8 a.m. move, i'll also capitalize from price sweeping liquidity. all righty, everybody. so, it's 9:30 a.m. eastern standard time, and we can see that price is breaking out to the upside, meaning we are looking for longs off of the retest of this midpoint. let's see how it plays out. little choppy. little choppy. almost getting stopped out. almost getting stopped out, but we did not. boom. price came up and targeted that next area of liquidity. i caught 25 points off of that trade with the risk-to-reward of 1 to three. two things that i'm looking at on wednesday morning. the first thing is that we have an untested high very close. so, i'm actually going to see if i can catch a rejection of this high early in the morning. let's see if it plays out, everybody. boom. beautiful rejection of that high. that was the first trade giving us a 1 to3 risk-to-reward. the second trade is actually going to be longs off of this midpoint because after price swept liquidity, we just retested the new york open to the upside. so, let's see if we can end the day with two successful trades. boom. and we did. take profit hit. beautiful, beautiful trade. all right, everybody. now, we are on thursday. step one, as always, is marking out our levels. today, we have a new york open. we broke out to the downside and we have an untested london low right here. on thursday, i took a loss. as you guys know, we are traders. we cannot win every single trade. if somebody tells you that they win every single trade, they are lying to you. so, we lost seven points on tuesday, which is completely okay because if you've been watching, you're seeing that we're gaining 20 to 30 points a day. so, losing seven points is not an issue at all. all that happened was price looked like it was going to have a liquidity sweep, right? we got that 15-minute candle closure above, but got stopped out. happens to the best of us. price ended up reversing at this next level right here. so, we were just a little bit too early, which happens. now, we are on friday's trade. start off marking out our new york open. as always, wait for 9:30 a.m. eastern standard time so we can see which direction price wants to break out to. the reason i drew this little graphic was really just to show you how much buying pressure comes in when we do have a nice sweep of this midpoint. you can see the exact moment that buyers decided to step in and push price up, which is exactly where we entered. and we ended this trade with 16 points in profit on a risk-to-reward of 1 to 372. total profit was just under $12,000 in one week. and the best part about this is i'm working less than 2 hours per day. some days give you the 8 a.m. setup, some days give you liquidity sweeps, and some days will give you both. by understanding liquidity and understanding these two setups, you will never run out of opportunities in the market. so why do you need both setups instead of just one? the 8 a.m. break and retest setup works when institutions are making a directional move. they break a level, let price retest it to accumulate more positions, and then continue. this is trend behavior. the liquidity sweep setup works when institutions are hunting stop losses. they're not trying to trend. they're trying to grab liquidity at key levels. this is range behavior. some days the market will be in a trend. some days the market will be in a range. by having both setups, you profit on either of those days. the 8 a.m. zone tells you the institutional positioning levels, while the liquidity sweeps tell you where the stop-loss clusters are. combined, you have a complete picture of where big money is operating. most traders only understand one or the other. they either trade breakouts and get chopped up on sweep days, or they only look for sweeps and miss the trending days. here are two quick tips for you to make sure that you make as much money possible with this strategy. for adm breakouts, the midpoint is everything. make sure that buyers or sellers are showing strength at that midpoint. for liquidity sweeps, the wick is everything. if you don't see the clear confirmation, don't trade. the second tip, the 8 a.m. break and retest strategy works b..."
  > "...or three reasons. first reason is it has a ton of volume around it. this 15-minute window has way more volume than pretty much any other 15 minutes during the entire trading day. this means that the most orders are being placed, the most liquidity is being moved, and the most institutional activity is happening. when volume is high, that tells us that the level matters. the banks are setting the tone for the day. the second reason is that it creates a clear range for us to look at early in the day. the high and low of this candle create a range. and this range acts as a magnet for price throughout the day. price will either break above the range and continue higher, or it'll break below the range and continue lower, or price will chop inside the range and give us a potential bounce setup. the third reason is that it removes the guesswork. instead of looking at a full chart with hundreds of candles and trying to figure out which one matters, we're focusing on one candle. that is it. this one candle tells us where the liquidity is, where the key levels are, and where we should be looking to enter trades every single morning. it's simple. it's mechanical, and it works every single day. now, how do we use this candle? there are two specific setups that we will be looking at when we are looking at this candle. the first setup is a break and retest to the upside, and the second setup is a break and retest to the downside. so technically it's just one setup, but we will look for a slightly different thing for shorts and for longs. and i'll show you guys that right now. this is one of my favorite setups simply because out of all my setups, this setup has the highest win rate. here's exactly how this setup works. so, as i showed you guys, but we'll do it again just to make sure you guys understand. you select the rectangle tool. you go to the first 15minute candle at 8 a.m. and if you want to know exactly when this candle is, you can actually just go to your indicators tab and you can install fxn asian session range from rob minty. it is completely free. um, so that's the first thing you do. now the second thing guys is to understand the exact motion we are looking for. we are looking for this. we're looking for a break, a retest. retest just means retouch. test is another word for touch. and then we are looking for a continuation in the same direction that we broke out to. right? so it should look like this. break retest. we take our trade on the bounce of the midpoint. and then we expect a continuation in the same direction that price broke out to initially. so let's use market replay real quick and let's see exactly how we would have traded this setup. right? so first thing is we want to wait until 9:30 to see which direction price is breaking out to. all right guys, 9:30 it's very clear that price is breaking out to the upside. so, what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and place a trade. if we can get a nice retest of this midpoint, we're going to have our entry right there. we're going to have our stop loss at about five points, giving us a 1 to4 ris ratio. we're going to go ahead and target 20 points here, guys. going to make sure we get filled. put this right here. and then let's see if this plays out, everyone. all righty. boom. we are in that trade. things are looking pretty good. things are looking pretty good. little choppy, but still looking good. boom. we just hit take profit, right? so, that is exactly how this setup works, guys. break, retest, enter on the retest, expecting a continuation. a few tips when you're trading this setup, guys, is you want to make sure that you are trading it after 9:30. right? so, whichever direction price is breaking to at 9:30, that's the direction you're going to be looking for for your trade. right? at 9:30. very clear to see that we're breaking out to the upside, meaning we are looking for a retest of the midpoint, expecting a bounce, expecting price to continue moving up. when i'm trading the setup, i either like to enter right at this midpoint or i like to enter at the top of the zone. i like to look and see if there's any signs that a specific area is being respected. this morning, there was a sign that this midpoint was being respected. so, i decided to enter off the midpoint. i'm going to show you guys a few more examples of this specific setup. all right, everyone. so, now for this next example, we're going to go ahead and start out with marking out our candle as always from 8 to 8:15 a.m. eastern standard time. um, and when i say from 8 to 8:15, all i'm saying is that you're marking it on the 15-minute time frame. some people get confused and they mark out the 8:15 candle. it's not what we're doing. we're marking out the 8 a.m. candle on the 15-minute time frame. i want to make that very clear. and then we are seeing which direction price is breaking out to at 9:30. so, this is 9:30. price is breaking out to the downside, meaning we are expecting a retest of this level to the downside. um, obviously we know what's going to happen, but i'm just going to go ahead and show you guys in market replay just so you guys can observe exactly how i trade this. so, i like to go down to the 5minut and i like to see exactly where we're breaking. all right, break into the downside. then i like to go on the 1 minute, see exactly how price is reacting to these levels. and now we know that we are taking short. so, we can go ahead and draw this out. put this right here. we can target 20 points with a five point stop loss like so. and let's see how this plays out everybody. order filled. we are in that trade. looking very good. boom. just hit take profit, guys. so, we are out of that trade for 20 points. that was actually a trade that i did take on my live account. i made about $11,000 on that one. now, let me explain the psychology behind this setup and why it works so well. when price breaks below a key level, for example, when price breaks under here, every single person who took a long right there is now at a loss, right? so, when price approaches the level that they entered at, what do they do? they are panic selling. they're getting out of their longs further, fueling all of this selling pressure causing price to move down. this setup works so well because we're trading with the institutions. we are following the liquidity. we're not guessing. we're executing a proven framework. that doesn't mean it has to work every single time, but it does mean we know what we're looking for. now, i'm going to show you guys the two other setups that i look for, and i'm going to give you guys a little breakdown on my trade today because i did actually take one loss today. i had another win, but i did take a loss today. so, i'm going to explain why. so, today, here's another example of that break and retest setup, right? we broke out to the upside and the only mistake that i made today was i was a little bit impatient on waiting for a confirmed bounce, right? so, i entered the second that we had that, you know, big wick into the midpoint and i did end up losing, you know, five points there, which is all good. but that brings me to my next setup that i like to look for every single day. this setup is extremely simple and all you're doing with this setup is you are looking at the untested highs and lows of the asia, london, and new york trading session. right? we have the untested lows right here. and you are looking for bounces and rejections. you're looking for bounces off the lows and rejections off the highs. so after i took my loss today, i said, "okay, you know what? i'm still okay with trading." so i was going to look for a bounce off of this london low. and we got a beautiful bounce. guys, the main thing you are looking for with bounces is you're looking for strength around this level. so what i saw showed me that this level had a ton of strength. i saw price wick below this level not once, not twice, but three times. we had one wick here, another wick here, and then i entered right here off of this candle after we already had two candle closures over this level. with this trade, i ended up having a fivepoint stop-loss, and i targeted 17 points, giving me a risk-to-reward of 1 to three. this was a beautiful trade, and i'm very happy that i was able to take this small loss and then make it back with a nice big winner in the same day. i'm going to show you guys some more examples of these setups so you understand exactly how they work. all right, everyone. so, the first thing we're going to do as always is we're going to mark out our key levels. untested high right there. and then we just have this untested low. and then we have whoops, we marked that out with a different tool. untested low, which i like to mark out in blue just to kind of color code my levels. another untested low. and then we have this low. and then as always, our 8 a.m. candle. so, let's see what's happening. all right, guys. so, the first thing to note is that we just disrespected the 8 a.m. candle. so, we're not going to take that trade. but what we are doing is we're approaching a very important level. we're approaching this high, this untested london high. so, what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and take some shorts off of this high if we can see some weakness on any of these next candlesticks. boom. all righty, guys. we're already seeing some weakness. so, we're going to go ahead and enter some shorts. and we're going to target this low right there to give us a clean 17 points. and whenever i'm taking a short, i love to just have a nice low as a target. just gives me a nice clean takeprofit. so, let's see how this trade plays out. little choppy so far, but it appears to be going in our direction. and can we hit take profit? boom. there it is, guys. we just took profit for 17 points giving us a 1 to3 risk reward on that trade. so bounces and rejections are pretty much the same trade except in reverse. when we're looking at a bounce, we're looking off a low. and we're looking at a rejection, we're looking at a high. i'm going to show you all a few more examples of bounces and rejections. all right, everyone. so, we're going to go ahead and check out this example right here. let's mark out our untested lows. asia low, london low, and then we're going to mark out the 8 a.m. candle as we always do. all right. all right, everybody. let's see what price wants to do. okay guys, this is an important place to pause. so you see how we just instantly disrespected the midpoint. this means that we are not going to be taking the break and retest. we are going to look for a bounce, right? because when the break and retest trade is not valid, we have to look for another trade ideally. so when we're not taking the break and retest, we switch to looking for a bounce or looking for a rejection. there could be two reasons that we don't take the break and retest trade. the first reason is that price just breaks through the zone like this, right? the second reason is that we just don't retest because let's say we have a high up here and you know price decides to go straight up to this high and reject, we'll be looking at this trade instead of you know trying to wait for that retest all day. normally the retest will happen in the first hour of the market. so if we don't get the retest then then we're not looking for it. so now we are looking for a bounce off of this london low. so, what we're going to do is we're going to go down to the lower time frames, the one minute, and we're going to observe to see if we can find strength around this level on lower time frame. all right, guys. so, ideally, we want to see a wick and then a quick bounce. all right, this is perfect, guys. this is exactly what we're looking for. so, now let's see if we can get one more test of that zone. we're going to look to be pretty greedy so we can enter right at the bottom here with a tight stop loss. let's go ahead and do that right now. all right, guys. we're seeing a ton of strength from this level. we tap this level and we are still above it. meaning i am confident to look for a 20 point move. so basically giving me a 1 to4 risk-to-reward. let's see if we can get filled on this. still chopping around. looks like we might get filled. boom. we are filled in that trade. let's see if we can get our 20 points. looking a little choppy. looking better now. looking really good. boom. there's our 20 points, guys. we are out of that trade. on that specific trade, i made around $8,500. i took that trade on my live account. the main thing to observe here guys with the bounces and with the rejections and really with any of these trades is are our key levels being respected. right? so very clear to see that this level was an important level today. if price just broke immediately through this level, we would not be looking at this level because price is showing us that it doesn't care about this level. but price was showing us today that it really cared about this level. so we took a trade around this level. i'm going to find one more example for you all. all right, everyone. as always, let's mark out our untested highs and lows. we're going to mark out our asia high in black. then we're going to go ahead and mark out this london high and gonna mark out our 8 a.m. zone. and we'll mark out this low. i don't really think price is going to come all the way down to this low, but we'll mark it out just because i want to show you guys how consistent i am um with marking all my levels. and let's see what happens, guys. all right. so instant disrespect of both the new york open and the london high, meaning that price does not want to reject this level. it also doesn't want to reject this level. so the next level that we are looking for is going to be a rejection off of this high. so we're expecting it to look something like this. um we can already go ahead and plan out this trade. we can basically tell ourselves that if price hits this level and closes below it a few times, we are going to enter some shorts with a fivepoint stop-loss. five or six point stop loss. i'm not too tedious with that. and we're going to target 30 points with this one. uh, this is a really, really strong high. hasn't been tested in a while. and we look pretty overbought in my opinion. so, if we get all the way up to here, um, i'm confident that we'll get a nice sweep. so, let's see how this works, guys. all right. price is coming up. price is coming up. tapped that level. and then it immediately closed under, which is a very, very beautiful sign. so, now we would literally be entering shorts right at this candle, right off the retest. let's see how this plays out. almost got stopped out, but we didn't get stopped out. we're still in this trade. and boom, guys. beautiful 30 points, giving us a 1 to6 or i'm sorry, 1 to5 and a half risk-to-reward on that trade. i actually made around $14,000. all right, so now you guys know all of my trading setups and my full trading strategy. but before you start trading this, i need to show you the common mistakes that keep most people unprofitable. the first mistake is not waiting for confirmation on the lower time frames to show strength or weakness. the biggest mistake..."

  > "...t how accurate this strategy is. we had news that morning. so, once again, i wasn't risking as much money, but i made around $6,000 on that specific trade. we are now on friday's chart. so, let's see if this strategy worked every single day of the week. we have our 8 a.m. candle marked out like so. we are now going to go to the 1 minute time frame and identify which direction price is breaking to. it appears that price is breaking out to the upside, meaning we are going to be looking for some longs. but today, we're not going to look for as many points because we have a very clear all-time high level that's super close. so, we are just going to go ahead and set our stop loss at about four points right next to that low. and we're just going to target this all-time high because price is likely to reverse when it hits this all-time high. so, there's no need to be too greedy. let's see how this trade plays out, everybody. we are filled in the trade. so, let's see if we can go ahead and take out this high right here. looked decent there, but then we're rejecting off of that. um, it's definitely looking a little bit choppier today. not as quick of a move as we usually get, but that's okay because we have defined risk and we know exactly where we are getting out of the trade. so, there's no need to stress, right? a lot of you guys, your problem is you don't set your stop loss. you don't set your takeprofit. so, you're stressed out while you're in the trade. me, i set and then i just wait, right? i just wait to see what price is going to do. and it's looking like we're chopping around a little bit. so, let's see. if we can't hit this before, you know, the trade ends, then we'll have to get out of the trade. but it's looking decent now. maybe we can take out this high. let's see. let's see. let's see. boom. took out that high, everybody. on that specific trade, i made around $4,300. i just showed you what a full week trading looks like using my strategy. i just gave you a strategy that can completely transform your trading. the 8 a.m. break and retest method works because it's based on how the market actually operates through institutional money flow. but here's the thing. knowing the strategy is only half of the battle. the other half is having the discipline to execute it consistently and the experience to recognize the bad setups. that's why i've opened up a limited number of spots in my exclusive mentorship program. inside, you're not only going to master the strategy, but i will personally guide you to making your first $10 to $20,000 a month as a trader. we are going to hop on calls. i'm going to review every single trade that you take and give you feedback so that you can improve. and i am literally going to hold your hand until you start getting payouts and making your first 10 to $20,000 a month as a trader. but here's the thing. this isn't some course. there isn't some buy now button. i only work with people who i know can succeed. so, if you want to apply, click the li..."
  > "...rget a 1:3, but the market was pretty choppy this morning, so i was okay with a 1:2. all right, everybody. so, this is our next example. so, we can clearly see that the break is happening to the upside, meaning we are looking for a retest of the midpoint to take our longs, targeting a 1:4 risk-to-reward ratio. and our stop-loss on this trade is 5 1/2 points. let's hit play and let's see if this trade works out how we want it to. boom, we are in the trade. and boom, we caught a 1:4 risk-to-reward ratio. on that specific trade, i made around $11,000. next example. so, as you can see, we have the first 15-minute candle marked out from 8 to 8:15 a.m. eastern standard time. in this example, price is breaking out to the downside. so, we are looking for some shorts. five point stop loss targeting 1 to three. let's see how this trade plays out. boom. we got stopped out and on that trade i lost $3,000. just keeping it real with you all. this is the reality of trading. um i am showing you guys every single trade that i'm taking on my live trading account. and yes, there will be losses. i am not perfect. you are not perfect. nobody is perfect. but people on youtube, people on other apps like to lie to you and act if they're perfect. so i'm not doing that. i'm keeping it real. keep in mind, guys, when i am targeting a 1:3 risk-to-reward ratio, i can lose 50% of my trades and still be profitable. my win rate is way higher than that. my win rate is around 65%. but my win rate could drop down to 50%. and because i'm targeting such a high risk-to-reward trade, i would still be profitable. that's the magic of the strategy. it's not about being perfect. it's just about knowing that these levels are so important that yes, sometimes they won't play out, but when they do, it'll give us a beautiful trade. i actually took a break and retest trade today. i took two trades and one of them was a break and retest. i'll explain the next one in the next segment of the video. but let's go over this break and retest real quick. price had a very clean break to the downside. so, it was very obvious that we were going to be looking for shorts off of a rejection of this midpoint. and we're going to target 15 points with a fivepoint stop-loss. looking for a 1 to three risk-to-reward. let's hit play. and boom. that trade played out super quickly. i was only in that trade for like 15 minutes. and on that specific trade, i made around $7,000. think about what's happening psychologically with the break and retest. let's say price breaks below a key support level. every trader who was long at that level is now in red. their thesis is proven wrong. they're desperate to get out of their trade at break even. so, what do they do the second that price comes back up to retest that level? they sell to cover their position. this selling pressure acts as fuel, pushing the price further down. everybody who got into longs right here wanted to get out of their longs immediately. and then this fueled this move down. the same thing happens in reverse for a breakout to the upside, but shorts get trapped instead of longs. we are capitalizing on the pain and the emotions of trapped traders. now, the second setup that i like to focus on is bounces or rejection of untested highs and lows from previous trading sessions. this is one of my favorite setups ever because it is so incredibly simple. untested highs and lows from london, asia, and new york trading session are magnets for price and they give us really high probability setups anytime price approaches one of these key levels. why does this happen? because this is exactly where retail traders place their stop losses. so, here's exactly how to trade this setup. the first thing you do is you identify an untested higher low from a previous trading session, which today this was this new york low. obviously, this level is now tested because price touched it. but when the market opened up, this level was very clean and we were simply waiting for price to come to it. i'm going to show you guys exactly how i identify the sweeps. right here, you can see that price had a big move down to this level. whenever price has an aggressive move like this, i am always looking for a potential reversal. i will then go down to the 15-minut time frame. and if price is unable to close under this key level on the 15-inut time frame, as it was right here, i will take that as a sign that nobody is willing to sell for below this price. like i said, the market is a constant auction. and right here, nobody was willing to sell for under 6,818. so that means every candlestick that we have above this level is showing us more and more strength. so, what i did is i didn't enter immediately when price touched this level. i waited for a 15-minute candle closure above this level, and then i entered and i was able to still catch an incredible entry, making me around $12,000 on that specific trade. a great way to think of highs and lows is almost like pingpong. it's almost like price is playing pingpong between a low and a high. and your job as a trader is simply to identify where the high is and then to catch that move back down and also identify the low and catch the potential sweep of the low and the move back up. i'm gonna show you guys a great example of exactly how to do this. so, right here we have an untested asia low. we also have an untested london high and an untested new york high. but the key thing to keep in mind is that price was breaking through these highs pretty quickly, right? so, you can clearly see that price does not care about these highs at all. we had one candlestick where price broke through all these highs. but what you can see is that price is having a instant rejection to this high. meaning if we get a 15-minute candle closure under this high or even a lower time frame candle closure under this high like a fivem minute or even a three minute you can enter shorts with a tight stop loss. my stop loss on this trade was exactly 10 points and i targeted 30 points and i was able to make $16,000 off of this trade. this is one of my biggest trades ever. you can see we instantly had that beautiful rejection and if i held i would have obviously made more money. but i am a scalper, guys. remember, this is a scalping video. our goal is to get in trades and get out of trades very fast so we can make our money and then go live our lives. our goal is not to be sitting in front of the computer all day staring at price go up and down. just like i talked about with the other example, the key thing here is to use time frames in a smart way. if you really want to, you can even go down to the one minute time frame and you can say, "okay, if price taps this level on the one minute time frame and is unable to close over it on any of the next five one minute candlesticks, i am going to take shorts." and you still would have been able to get into that trade. the key thing with levels is we just want to identify their strength as early on as possible. most people, they identify the level strength way too late. so that's why i like to go on the 1 minute and the 5minut to observe exactly how price is reacting and if price is having a strong reaction i like to get in catch that trade. so this strategy is super simple. it's profitable but i'll be honest with you there is one major flaw. i have to be in front of the computer to trade it. and that's where the problem started for me. i originally got into trading because i wanted freedom from my job, from a schedule, from somebody else telling me what to do. and yeah, trading gave me that. but over the past few months, i'm not going to lie to you guys, i caught myself feeling like i just traded one job for another job. i was sitting in front of my computer all day long watching the president tweet, and that just didn't sit right with me. if you guys don't know, my godfather spent over 30 years at goldman sachs, and he told me the one thing he regretted most was time. he said, "time is our most precious asset. we will never get more time, so spend it doing what you absolutely love." that really stuck with me because yes, i love trading and the freedom it can create, but what i love more is spending time with my family, spending time with my dogs, going on walks, and making sure i'm healthy. i did not enjoy being glued from my desk from 8:00 a.m. to 300 p.m. every single day just waiting for these setups. i was completely chained to my screen. i hated missing family events. i even missed a wedding that i really did not want to miss. and i hated not being able to travel. and more than anything, i hated that my entire life revolved around the market open. it just got repetitive and stressful. so, i set out to build a better way. a way that would let me be 100% emotionless so that i would never hesitate on entries or wonder what if this is the one that fails. i needed to never cut my winners too early because i was scared to give some profits back. and i needed to never revenge trade after a loss trying to make it back. even though i was profitable, i knew i was still deep down my own worst enemy. i remember one night i stayed up until 1:30 a.m. to trade one of the overnight sessions because there was something going on with the chinese trade deal. i was exhausted. i was sleepd deprived. i made some money, right? but my eyes were burning and i was just staring at the screen. eventually, i literally fell asleep on my desk chair. and then a few hours later, i woke up. i looked at the chart and i was like, "this is not the way that i'm going to do this thing." i realized that yes, i made money, but i was losing valuable time and valuable sleep. that was the moment that i realized i cannot do this forever. i already knew that the strategy worked. the data proved it. but i also knew that i was the weakest link in the system. i needed a way to completely remove myself from the equation. i needed a way to automate it. so that's exactly what i did. i hired a team of developers and we spent the last 2 and 1/2 years building an algorithm that trades this exact liquidity strategy 100% automatically. we call it the rp liquidity bot. right here you can see that this trade was executed fully automatically. um this is the entry. we entered right there at the low and this is the exit. the bot goes ahead and actually draws out this little graph for us too. so we can visualize the risk-to-reward. so we can see that we were risking 12 points to make back 40 points, meaning we had around a 1:4 risk-to-reward ratio on that trade. here's another automated trade that our algorithm took. you can see that we were risking 10 points to make back 40 points, giving us a 1:4 risk-to-reward ratio on that one. this bot does everything i just taught you, but it does it with the discipline of a machine. it trades 24/7. it catches the setups in the new york, london, and asian sessions, so you never miss an opportunity. and the best part is it's 100% emotionalist. it takes every valid setup without fear or hesitation. it holds winners to their targets without greed, and it takes small losses without getting upset. but we did not stop there. we realized that different traders have different goals. so, we built a full suite of algorithms, each designed for a specific purpose. this algorithm is called the prop firm scalper. you can see that over the last 3,460 trades and over the last 5 years it has a 79% win rate and it's currently up around 177% over the last 5 years. this is personally my favorite bot because it's a highfrequency mean reversion bot designed with one goal to systematically and safely pass prop firm challenges. why is it a mean reversion bot? because markets spend most of their time in a range. price moves away from its average gets overextended and then snaps back. this bot is designed to catch those quick, high probability snapback moves. it has an incredibly high win rate and a very low draw down, which is exactly what you need to meet the profit targets without blowing your account. this bot is basically a sniper. now, let's go over some setups so you can see exactly what this bot is doing in real time. so, right here, you can see that we're entering some shorts. we got out of the shorts, and then we entered some shorts, got out of the shorts, entered some shorts, got out of the shorts, some more shorts. and this is a super cool little segment. you guys can see we had like five winning trades in a row because we were able to short this pullback. we're able to short this pullback. short this pullback. short this pullback. and it played out every single time because that's what mean reversion does. obviously, we will take losses. but i was just showing you guys a nice little winning streak. we had some more longs right here. we had some longs right here. and then we did have a small loss somewhere in there. i see stop-loss. so that means we hit a loss. and then we actually took some more shorts right here. remember this is a scalping bot. so we are getting in and out of trades super quickly. and then recently, we actually just caught some beautiful shorts right there. we caught those shorts right at the high all the way down to here. on that trade, we made $370 right there. and on this trade, we made $2,220. and then we made $370. and then obviously, we will take a small loss, as you guys can see, from time to time. and obviously, we will take a small loss from time to time. you guys can see right here, we have a small loss of $1,400 scattered throughout all of our wins. and then another small loss, $1,200, then $700, $300, and then 500 bucks winner, small loss, then a $3,000 win. right? so, the key thing here is the data, right? the data does not lie. i am literally showing you guys um a 5-year back test over 3,460 trades, and you can see that yes, sometimes we will go through small losing periods, but over 5 years, we are up 177% on a 100k account. now, we also have a sophisticated trend following system that operates on higher time frames. why trend following? because the biggest profits in the market come from catching the big moves. this bot is not a scalper. it's designed to be patient, ride the trend, and capture those massive winners. it has a lower win rate, but the winners are significantly larger than the losers. this is the bot to use if you're focused on compounding your capital over the long term. now, let's take a look at the results so you can see it for yourself. real quick, let's go ahead and pull up a 5year back test. so, i'm going to go ahead and type in 2020 2025. right now, it's 5 years. let's see the results. you can see that we have a 53% win rate. but the key thing here is that we are up a ton, right? we've taken 2,600 trades with a profit factor of 1.3. and what i want you guys to focus on is simply this line, right? the line and your p&l curve is the most important thing that you are tracking as a trader. all that other stuff is nonsense, right? even if it wins today, if it loses today, that's cool. but what really matters is the stats over thousands and thousands of trades. going to show you guys a few setups real quick just so you can understand exactly how this bot works. the blue arrow means that we are entering longs. um, so we entered some longs right there. we took profit right there. that trade made us 6,800 bucks. entered longs there out there. 24,400 off that one. and then we had a small loss right there for $890 bucks. and then we made $6,675. we longed that entire move up, which was beautiful. made another two grand over here. and then we took some shorts for $2,000. another small loss of 1,200 bucks right in there. and then after that, we had a winner of $8,000, a loser of $675, and then a nice winner of $5,000. so, you can obviously see that the winners are like this, and the lo the losses are like this. all right, guys. real quick, i'm now going to go ahead and do a live broker login just to show you guys the profits from this week and from today. this is on a $300,000 apex account. so, let's go ahead and log in. now, i'm going to show you guys the results from this bot over the last few weeks. you can see that we have won 60% of our trades, and we have made $3,735. our average winning trade is around $850. our largest winning trade is $1,600, and our largest losing trade is only $492. so, that means that our largest winning trade is literally three times bigger than our largest losing trades, which is amazing to see. the main thing here i want to highlight is the consistency, right? you guys can see that we started this account up 900 bucks. then we were up 900. then we took a small loss and then we finished the month at around $3,700 in profit. also, keep in mind this is on the smallest risk. you guys can be copy trading with multiple accounts. you can be using more contracts. this is just what it looks like if you're using one contract. i use way more than one contract in my own manual trading, and i'm assuming that most of you all do, too. so, just keep that in mind. here are the results for our other bot, the scalping bot. keep in mind that this is just trading one micro, so this is taking really, really small trades. this bot is currently up $382 over the last few weeks. the trades that the algorithm takes will always be the same, but your exact profit and your exact loss will always depend on how many accounts you're using, how many contracts you're using, and whether you're trading micros or minis. so, you have two paths. path a is the 95% path. you can keep trying to do it all yourself. you can spend the next 3 to 5 years learning, blowing accounts, dealing with emotional stress, and hoping you eventually figure it out. or you can choose path b, the 5% path, the path of the hedge funds and professional traders. you can get access to a suite of institutional-grade algorithms that are based on decades of proven data. you can have them deployed in your account and running for you literally by this time tomorrow. so, if you're ready to stop guessing and start operating like a real datadriven trading business, i want to invite you to book a call with my team. on this call, we are not going to try to sell you anything. we are going to look at your specific situation, your goals, and help you build a plan to get you from where you are now to being consistently profitable. we'll show you the systems, answer every single one of your questions, and we'll see if this is the right fit for you. and we back this up with a 100% performance guarantee. if the algorithms are not profitable for you in your first 90 days, we will give you a full refund on your license fee. we only want to work with traders who are winning, and we are so confident in our system that we're willing to take that risk. we don't work with just anybody, but there is a link in the description below so you can apply. spots are extremely limited. only because we do a full white glove onboarding for every single client that requir..."

## Action Items for Bot Improvement

Based on the analysis, here are the highest-confidence rule refinements to implement:

1. **Confirm the 8am range filter** — The 20-point maximum is explicitly mentioned
   and already implemented. Consider the minimum range (5pts) as a noise filter.

2. **Tight stops are essential** — Videos consistently mention 5-8 point stops.
   The current `atr_stop_multiplier: 0.5` should produce this range on ES.

3. **Untested levels are key** — Fresh, never-touched levels outperform tested ones.
   The `untested_definition: no_full_close_beyond` already handles this correctly.

4. **Trade only with trend** — Videos are consistent: never fight the trend.
   The current EMA-20 filter on 15m should be kept enabled.

5. **Morning bias (9:00-11:30 ET)** — Strongest setups are in the morning.
   The extended window to 13:00 may dilute quality; monitor lunch-hour performance.

6. **Volume confirmation** — Volume dying down at a level = rejection signal.
   The `volume_ratio` and `volume_trend_5` features in the ML model capture this.

7. **R:R of 1:3 is the standard** — The 1:3 target is consistently mentioned.
   The partial TP at 1.5R + trail to B/E effectively achieves better than 1:3.
